        <p> 
            About a year ago, I found myself pondering what kind of website a student—or anyone in today's fast-paced 
            world—might truly need. My first whimsical thought, reminiscent of a teenage dream app, was to create something 
            that functioned as a friend. This reflection soon crystallized around a serious concern: mental health was 
            not easily accessible. Therapists can be costly, and not everyone feels comfortable discussing their problems 
            face-to-face. Additionally, many people simply do not have the time or energy for traditional therapy. 
            However, we all use our phones daily and are often comfortable sharing our thoughts through them. </p>
        <p>
            This realization inspired me to create an app aimed at making mental health support accessible. 
            Initially unaware that this idea would lead to GentleAI, I was reminded of it during a recent Google Gemini hackathon, 
            where I encountered a problem statement focused on developing a mental health chatbot for students. 
            Thus, GentleAI came to life. The goal of GentleAI is not to prescribe medication for mental health disorders or 
            provide advice for severe issues; rather, it is a web application designed for users to share their thoughts and feelings, 
            which are reciprocated by a chatbot.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project is still a work in progress, and I advise caution as Gemini may sometimes generate unexpected responses.
            For serious concerns, consulting a professional or a trusted adult is always recommended. While GentleAI primarily 
            targets students grappling with exam stress and other everyday pressures, anyone interested in discussing mental health is welcome.
            Ultimately, I hope users realize their importance and understand that they can overcome their challenges. 
            Mental health is vital, and seeking help carries no shame.
        </p>
        <p>Fun fact: The name "GentleAI" emerged from my desire to incorporate "Gen" from Generative AI, 
            with "Gentle" representing the warmth, empathy, and care associated with good mental health. </p>

        <hr>
        <p>When users click the "Let's Talk About It" button on the home page, 
            they are taken to the Chatbot page. Here, they can choose to either browse 
            from a list of pre-suggested questions or enter a custom query to 
            address their specific concerns. GentleAI leverages the Google Gemini API to search 
            for responses, utilizing an extensive and robust dataset to provide meaningful,
             contextually accurate answers.</p>
        <p>Once a valid response is found, it's displayed directly to the user, offering a seamless, 
            user-friendly experience. GentleAI is designed to support users in exploring mental health 
            topics in a comfortable and accessible way, making information and empathetic responses 
            readily available. This project reflects a careful understanding of user needs, 
            emphasizing accessibility, responsiveness, and the use of advanced AI to make 
            mental health support approachable for everyone. </p>
        <p>With GentleAI, I aim to make mental health more accessible, 
            offering support when you need it most. So, whenever you're ready, let's talk.</p>
